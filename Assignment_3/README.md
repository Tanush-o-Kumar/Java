Create a Book class with appropriate constructors.

Create a User defined exception class called InvalidPriceException.

One of the constructors of Book should throw InvalidPriceException if the price < 0.

Create another class called ArrayListOfBooks with main method.

Create multiple Book objects and add them to an ArrayList of Books.

Use the constructor that throws InvalidPriceException inside a try-catch block and try to create a Book object with negative price value.

The output should display the attribute values of all objects from the ArrayList. Also, calculate the average price of books and print it.

Also, print books of a particular genre such as "Fiction" using forEach() method of ArrayList.
